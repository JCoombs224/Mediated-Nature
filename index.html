          <h2>Mediated Nature</h2>
          <h5>Jamison Coombs</h5>
          <p>
            My intent for this assignment was to represent the natural phenomenon of seasons in nature as an
             interactive website that would allow you to cycle through it. I started off by producing the image
              of the tree trunk and branches in Adobe Illustrator. This would be the base that would represent
               wintertime when the trees have no leaves. I then created separate drawings of leaves with
                different colors for each season that I could layer on top of the base trunk image. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After I had the images I would need, I coded up a webpage to be the base for this assignment. I then
             programmed the animation that would fade between the different images based on the current season and
              a button to trigger the animations. Once I had that down, I added the spinner with an arrow to show the
               current season.
